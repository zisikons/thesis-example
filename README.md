Î‘n online identification experiment of a 2-DOF robotic manipulator. 

## Summary
This work is a system identification study, and it's main purpose is the identification of a non-linear conitnuous system 
on a region of interest. The work is based on  Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) [1], Radial Basis Neural Networks 
(RBF-NNs) [2] and the results of [3] on the satisfaction of the Persistancy of Excitation condition for RBF-NNs.


## How to launch
To run this simulation, you will need MATLAB (at least R2015b). So, clone the folder and run the script as follows:
```matlab
cd demo
robot_example
% ... wait a lot ...
```

To plot the weights convergence you can edit and run the ```sig_recreation.m``` script inside ```demo/```.
