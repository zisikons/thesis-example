Î‘n online identification experiment of a 2-DOF robotic manipulator


## How to launch
To run this simulation, you will need MATLAB (at least R2015b). So, clone the folder and run the script as follows:
```matlab
cd demo
robot_example
% ... wait a lot ...
```

To plot the weights convergence you can edit and run the ```sig_recreation.m``` script inside ```demo/```.
